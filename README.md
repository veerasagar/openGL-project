# OpenGL-project


OpenGL projects refer to computer graphics applications or software that utilize the OpenGL API to create and render 2D or 3D graphics. These projects can range from simple demos and simulations to complex video games, scientific visualizations, architectural designs, and virtual reality experiences.


OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is an open standard graphics API (Application Programming Interface) that allows developers to create high-performance, cross-platform, and hardware-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics applications. It provides a set of functions and commands for rendering graphics, handling input events, and managing the graphics context.
